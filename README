The code here is a libusb based implementation to access the saleae logic analyzer. 
You can find more information about the logic analyzer on the following website
http://www.saleae.com/logic/. 

As I write this, the capture is working well at 8MHz on a 5,6 macbook pro... sometimes i can push it to 
12 mhz but this is extremely unreliable.. not sure if its me, libusb or the OS, but sigrok seems to have 
the same problem.

!!UPDATE!!
  insomnia induced fixes seem to have done the trick, 

albert:saleae-logic-libusb phar$ time ./main  -f foo -r 24MHz -n 2000000000 -d 3
Begin Capture
Capture Success!
Capture finished with exit code 4

Thats a sustained 24MHz capture for 2Gcaptures  on OSX which even the  saleae software wont do.




unlike previous versions of this program, it does not have a hardcoded firmware blob and weird 
USB capture replay foo.. and since i cannot provide saleae logic firmware under a GPL license 
you will have to extract the firmware yourself... these directions will produce a functional fimrware
image that can be used, you will need to download the stock saleae software from their website and extract
the WinUSBLogicInterface.dll file from the package and run the following commands:

for firmware version 1.0.33:
	dd if=WinUSBLogicInterface.dll of=fw.hex skip=8036 count=17366 bs=1

for firmware version 1.0.21:
	dd if=USBDeviceInterface.dll of=fw.hex skip=4220 count=17366 bs=1

this only seems to work for GNU objcopy, i will figure out the command line for OSX later
	objcopy -Iihex fw.hex -Obinary saleae-logic.firmware


Implemented features
-firmware upload
-streaming data out
